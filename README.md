# Defeat-the-Evil-Wizard

Simply run the app.py to run the game. 

When you run it, you will be met with a choice of heros. Choose wisely as you will not be able to change hero classes once selected.

Once you've chosen a class, you will be able to name your hero.

Then, you will enter the fight. 

Each class has two abilities as well as an infinite supply of health potions. 

You may also view your character stats and abilities at any time without losing an action.

Be mindful when choosing what ability to use. You only get one action (i.e., use potion or one of your two abilities.)

I hope you enjoy! Good luck!
